## About this project
*EauClaireWare* is a .Net 5 web application adhering to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. This project was created as an [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) weekly independent project. 

This application allows a salon owner to track a list of stylists, a list of clients, and to associate those clients with a stylist.
